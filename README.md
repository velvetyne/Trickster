## Pr√©sentation

```
Trickster is a typeface mixing a lot of oddities smoothly.

Sans-serif, but with calligraphic influence and strong contrast, 
Trickster borrows shapes from Merovingian writing, Blackletters construction 
and contemporean drawing. Trickster is a display typeface in one bold weight. 
Its unusual shapes, tight spacing and various alternates allow designers 
to create quickly strong headlines and beautiful titling.
